      <h1>coseos reverse proxy servlet</h1>
      <p>
          A simple reverse proxy
      </p>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
          The <strong>coseos reverse proxy servlet</strong> is a simple reverse proxy.
          It is a servlet intended for use with a tomcat web server to help migrate
          monolithic web apps to micro services.          
      </p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
          You have a legacy tomcat installation running one or more servlet's that are
          rather monolithic. You want to extrapolate a servlet or parts of a monolithic
          servlet, based on the path and forward the corresponding requests to a modern
          micro service. By doing so, you can migrate parts of the application step by step. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Don't get me wrong: Tomcat is a great web server. It just no fun working with
          older versions of tomcat. You may write your modern micro service web server
          with a up to date version of tomcat.
      </p>
      <h2>Build</h2>
      <p>
          You should download or check out the source and build your own reverse proxy
          with maven. You can configure everything on the command line. There is no need
          to touch the source code at all that work on localhost forwarding requests to
          port 8080 (your legacy tomcat) to 4567 (your modern micro service).          
      </p>
      <div>
          <pre>mvn -Dproxy-port=8080 -Dweb-port=4567 -Dwar-filename=your#proxy clean install</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
          This should give you a file name <strong>your#proxy.war</strong>
      </p>
      <h3>web.xml.url-pattern</h3>
      <p>
          Use this parameter to set the <strong>url-pattern</strong> in the
          <strong>WEB-INF/web.xml</strong>.
          The <strong>coseos reverse proxy servlet</strong> will only work
          in this path. The default value, <strong>/</strong> will give you
          a proxy that acts on a context.
      </p>
      <h3>proxy-host</h3>
      <p>
          Use this parameter to set the proxy host name. This should match to the host name
          that is running the tomcat instance where you want to install the
          <strong>coseos reverse proxy servlet</strong>, usually localhost for development. 
      </p>
      <h3>proxy-port</h3>
      <p>
          Use this parameter to set the proxy port name. This should match to the port number
          that is running the tomcat instance where you want to install the
          <strong>coseos reverse proxy servlet</strong>, usually 8080 by default. 
      </p>
      <h3>web-host</h3>
      <p>
          Use this parameter to set the web server host name that the proxy will forward
          the requests to. For development, usually this is localhost, too. 
      </p>
      <h3>web-port</h3>
      <p>
          Use this parameter to set the web server port number that the proxy will forward
          requests to. Port numbers for proxy-port and web-port have to be different when
          proxy-host and web-host are the same.
      </p>
      <h2>Proxy</h2>
      <p>
          Remember that this is a simple proxy. It will not touch the path, path variables,
          body, method or anything else with only a few exceptions from this rule.
      </p>
      <h3>Host Header</h3>
      <p>
          The <strong>Host:</strong> header is modified by the proxy when a request is
          made including this header, using the hidden server and port for the new value.
          When the request to the proxy does not include the <strong>Host:</strong> header,
          no additional <strong>Host:</strong> header is added to the forwarded request.
      </p>
      <div>
          <pre>Host: localhost:8080</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
          The proxy will modify the host entry to match the values provided by web-host
          and web-port.
      </p>
      <div>
          <pre>Host: localhost:4567</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
          This modification may be necessary, because the web server that receives the
          forwarded request may check the value of the <strong>Host:</strong> header and
          reject requests that are not intended for that web server.
      </p>
      <p>
          The proxy will not verify that a <strong>Host:</strong> header in the request
          to the proxy matches the proxy or the web server. It will simply replace it.
      </p>
